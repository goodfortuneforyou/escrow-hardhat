# escrow-hardhat
This DApp allows the user (deployer and arbiter) to deploy Escrow Smart Contracts by adding a beneficiary. Only the arbiter can approve the contract, and when this happens the beneficiary is allowed to withdraw the contract funds. The app has the contract code and test, the frontend React App, and a server that allows persistent data to be retrieved in the UI.
